# Boot Security Parameter Checker

A Windows GUI application that checks important boot and security parameters on your system.

## Features

This application checks the following boot and security parameters:

- **UEFI Mode**: Verifies if the system is running in UEFI or Legacy BIOS mode
- **Secure Boot**: Checks if Secure Boot is enabled
- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: Detects TPM presence and version
- **Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)**: Checks if VBS is enabled
- **BitLocker**: Verifies BitLocker encryption status
- **Windows Defender**: Checks Tamper Protection status

## Building the Application

### Using CMake (Recommended)

```batch
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Using Visual Studio

1. Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run:
```batch
cl /EHsc /W3 main.cpp /link comctl32.lib tbs.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS
```

### Using MinGW

```batch
g++ -municode -mwindows main.cpp -o BootCheck.exe -lcomctl32 -ltbs -lgdi32
```

## Usage

1. Run the `BootCheck.exe` executable
2. The application will automatically check all boot parameters on startup
3. Click the "Check Boot Parameters" button to refresh the results
4. Review the security status of your system

## Requirements

- Windows 7 or later (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- Administrator privileges may be required for some checks
- TPM hardware (for TPM checks)

## Security Parameters Explained

### Secure Boot
Secure Boot helps protect your system from malware by only allowing trusted operating systems to boot. **Status: Enabled** is recommended for maximum security.

### TPM
Trusted Platform Module is a hardware security chip that provides cryptographic functions. Required for Windows 11 and BitLocker.

### UEFI Mode
UEFI is the modern replacement for Legacy BIOS and provides better security features including Secure Boot support.

### Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)
VBS uses hardware virtualization to create isolated regions of memory, protecting critical system components from malware.

### BitLocker
Full disk encryption that protects your data if your device is lost or stolen.

## Note

Some features may show as "UNKNOWN" if:
- The feature is not configured on your system
